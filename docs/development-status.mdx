# Development Status

IAM Zero is currently in active development in an alpha state. We're confident that it can be run locally or in development environments - and we need your help to try it out and give feedback!

Our initial target for a stable release is supporting least-privilege permission generation for AWS covering all major services, with instrumentation for Python applications (and potentially other languages too, depending on community feedback). Beyond this we plan on improving functionality and workflows relating to permission administration and expanding to other languages and cloud providers.

We don't yet recommend running IAM Zero in production environments.
