# Application Development

## Supported languages

Currently our supported languages for IAM Zero instrumentation are:

- Python

## Installing the client library in your codebase

IAM Zero can capture permission errors when you are developing services which use cloud resources, and recommend least-privilege policies automatically. To do this we provide a client library which can be installed in your project.

The client libraries are lightweight and use the same techniques the error-tracking libraries like Sentry and BugSnag to detect issues. They are also designed to be added and removed easily, so you can add the client while developing a service and then remove it once you're happy with the IAM policies you've built for it.

To start capturing permissions errors, install the IAM Zero client library:

<Tabs
  groupId="programming-language"
  defaultValue="python"
  values={[{ label: "Python", value: "python" }]}
>
  <TabItem value="python">

```bash
pip install iamzero
```

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, initialise IAM Zero as early as possible in your program's startup script:

<Tabs
  groupId="programming-language"
  defaultValue="python"
  values={[{ label: "Python", value: "python" }]}
>
  <TabItem value="python">

```py
import iamzero

iamzero.init()
```

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>
