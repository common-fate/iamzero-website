# AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda should work out of the box but please let us know on Slack if you have any issues. We are tracking progress on Lambda testing in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/common-fate/iamzero/issues/4).

To use IAM Zero with AWS Lambda you will need to write your Lambda in a [supported language](/docs/usage/app-development#supported-languages) so it can be instrumented for permissions errors. You will also need to ensure that your Lambda function has the [correct environment variables configured](/docs/configuration/client-configuration).
