# Contributing

We welcome all contributions to IAM Zero. Please read our [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/common-fate/iamzero/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Installation

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Editing docs

All of our documentation lives in the `docs` folder of this repository and is written in [MDX](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Currently the website is deployed via [Render](http://render.com/), which automatically rebuilds upon commits to the `main` branch.
